# 📚 Book Recommendation Backend

A modular and scalable file-based Book Management & Rating System built in **C++** using **OOP, STL, and hash-based indexing**.  
This project uses real-world structured data and is designed so that a recommendation engine can be integrated in the future.

## 🚀 Features

✅ Load books, users, and ratings from files  
✅ Search book in **O(1)** using `unordered_map`  
✅ Display book details  
✅ Compute **top-rated books** using hash aggregation  
✅ Modular OOP-based architecture

## 🧠 System Design

- **Book Module** → stores book metadata
- **User Module** → stores user demographic data
- **Rating Module** → connects users with books
- **Fast Search Index** → ISBN → Book (HashMap)

This structure mimics real backend services and allows future recommendation logic.
